# Introduction

This vignette presents a benchmarking analysis comparing the performance of functions from the `fio` package with equivalent base R functions. The `fio` package provides a set of functions for input-output analysis, a method used in economics to analyze the interdependencies between different sectors of an economy.

In this document, we will focus on two key functions: the technical coefficients matrix calculation and the Leontief inverse matrix calculation. These functions are fundamental to input-output analysis, and their performance can significantly impact the speed of larger analyses.

Our benchmarking tests, which involve running these functions repeatedely in simulated datasets, show that the `fio` package functions are faster than the equivalent base R functions. This improved performance can make a substantial difference in larger analyses, making the `fio` package a valuable tool for input-output analysis in R.

The tests were run on a simulated $2000 \times 2000$ matrix, and each test was repeated 100 times to account for variability. Please note that the results of this benchmarking analysis are dependent on the specific test datasets used and the hardware on which the algorithms were run. Therefore, the results should be interpreted in the context of these specific conditions.

## Technical coefficients matrix

The technical coefficients matrix calculation, a key and initial step in input-output analysis, was tested using the `compute_tech_coeff()` function from the `{fio}` package, equivalent functions from the `{leontief}` package, and a base R implementation. It consists on dividing each $a_{ij}$ element of intermediate transactions matrix by the correspondent $x_j$ element of total production vector^[Or in a equivalent way, multiplying intermediate transactions matrix by a diagonal matrix constructed from total production vector.]. The results show that both `{fio}` and `{leontief}` functions execute almost instantaneously, with `{leontief}` slightly faster (about 15 milliseconds apart). In contrast, the base R implementation is about 130 times slower than `{fio}`.


``` r
# set seed
set.seed(100)

# data
matrix_dim <- 2000
intermediate_transactions <- matrix(
  as.double(sample(1:1000, matrix_dim^2, replace = TRUE)),
  nrow = matrix_dim,
  ncol = matrix_dim
)
total_production <- matrix(
  as.double(sample(4000000:6000000, matrix_dim, replace = TRUE)),
  nrow = 1,
  ncol = matrix_dim
)

# Base R function
tech_coeff_r <- function(intermediate_transactions, total_production) {
  tech_coeff_matrix <- intermediate_transactions %*% diag(1 / as.vector(total_production))
  return(tech_coeff_matrix)
}

# {fio} setup
iom_fio <- fio::iom$new("iom", intermediate_transactions, total_production)

# benchmark
benchmark_a <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  fio = fio:::compute_tech_coeff(intermediate_transactions, total_production),
  `Base R` = tech_coeff_r(intermediate_transactions, total_production),
  leontief = leontief::input_requirement(intermediate_transactions, total_production),
  times = 100
)
print(benchmark_a)

## Leontief inverse matrix

When we're talking about inverting a $2000 \times 2000$ there's a lot more work involved. Leontief matrix ($B$) is obtained from subtracting the technical coefficients matrix ($A$) from the identity matrix ($I$), therefore it has no null rows or columns. 

$$B = I - A$$

It allows for solving the linear system through LU decomposition, which is a more efficient method than the direct inverse matrix calculation. `{fio}` takes advantage of LU decomposition and becomes incredibly faster, while `{leontief}` is about 18 times slower, followed closed by the 20 times slower base R implementation. 


``` r
# data
iom_fio <- iom_fio$compute_tech_coeff()
technical_coefficients_matrix <- iom_fio$technical_coefficients_matrix

# R function
leontief_inverse_r <- function(technical_coefficients_matrix) {
  dim <- nrow(technical_coefficients_matrix)
  leontief_inverse_matrix <- solve(diag(dim) - technical_coefficients_matrix)
  return(leontief_inverse_matrix)
}

# benchmark
benchmark_b <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  fio = fio:::compute_leontief_inverse(technical_coefficients_matrix),
  `Base R` = leontief_inverse_r(technical_coefficients_matrix),
  leontief = leontief::leontief_inverse(technical_coefficients_matrix),
  times = 100
)
print(benchmark_b)
#> Unit: milliseconds
#>      expr       min        lq      mean    median        uq       max neval

#>    Base R 6322.7461 6430.9753 6559.2352 6507.0055 6640.5332 7143.2907   100
